# Blog Client

The Blog Client is the front end of the blog system, designed to work seamlessly with the [Blog API](https://github.com/kristenmazza/blog-api) and the [Blog CMS](https://github.com/kristenmazza/blog-cms). This client provides a user-friendly interface for readers to interact with the blog.
